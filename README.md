# API-Libary
So, I recently completed a vanilla JS project that lets the user choose their favorite TV show from an API stock using HTML, CSS, JS, and OOP principles with classes. The project also uses AJAX and local storage to store user preferences.

The project was a great way for me to practice working with APIs and manipulating data in JavaScript. To start, I used HTML and CSS to create a simple, clean interface that lets the user choose their favorite TV show from a dropdown menu.

Then, using AJAX, I made a request to the API to retrieve data about the selected TV show, including its title, description, and image. I used OOP principles and classes to organize my code and make it more maintainable and scalable.

The project also uses local storage to store the user's favorite TV show, so that they can easily access it the next time they use the app. This was a great way for me to practice working with local storage and manipulating data in JavaScript.

Overall, I'm really happy with how the project turned out, and I feel like it showcases my skills in JavaScript and working with APIs. It was a fun and challenging project that helped me grow as a developer, and I'm excited to continue building on the skills I developed through this project.
