# API-Libary

I completed a vanilla JS project using HTML, CSS, and JS with OOP principles.<br>
It lets users choose their favorite TV show from an API stock.<br>
AJAX is used to fetch show details, and local storage stores user preferences for easy access.<br>
It was a fun and challenging project that enhanced my skills in working with APIs and data manipulation.<br>
I'm proud of the outcome and excited to build on these skills further.
